# 📰 Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

This project is a web-based Fake News Detection system built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn**. It classifies news articles as either **Real** or **Fake** using a trained machine learning model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts whether a news article is fake or real
- TF-IDF feature engineering
- Logistic Regression model
- Streamlit-based interactive web app
- Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 Model

- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Extracts features from text
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification
- Optionally supports **Naive Bayes**
